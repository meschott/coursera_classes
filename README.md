Within this repsository contains the coursework that I completed for the Coursera class Statistical Mechanics: Algorithms and Computations.
This course covered various topics including: Markov Chain Monte Carlo, Bose Einstein Condensates, Molecular Dynamics, Levy Path Sampling, 
phase transitions in the Ising model. Code samples provided by the instructors are in the program* directory and my own work is in the hw* 
directories. In order to effectively complete the assignments I had to understand and add to existing code.
